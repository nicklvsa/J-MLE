## J-MLE

J-MLE is a custom string parser in Java that is somewhat similar to json. I wanted to make something that could parse custom syntax that I wrote.

### Info

Yes, this project actually includes json library. This is used to parse respond from the server when using "@store" feature. This feature is not very well implemented, but I will be providing the php backend in the "backend" directory.

### TODO

- Fix cloud storing
- Better parsing
- Remove code that doesn't do anything anymore
